# Description
- The Mutant Detection API is an application that allows you to identify if a DNA sequence belongs to a mutant. The API analyzes the DNA sequence for specific patterns and determines whether the DNA is mutant based on the presence of more than one sequence of four consecutive identical letters in any direction (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).

- The application is implemented in FastAPI and uses a hexagonal architecture to separate business logic, data access, and API entry points.
